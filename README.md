# Web-Scraping-Tool-for-Business-Related-Data
Plan and Approach
This project requires building a scalable and efficient web scraping tool with data cleaning and preparation capabilities. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. Development Plan
Tools and Libraries
Python Libraries for Scraping:
BeautifulSoup: For parsing HTML.
Scrapy: For scalable scraping.
Selenium: For scraping dynamic JavaScript-rendered content.
Data Processing and Cleaning:
pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
re: For regex-based data formatting.
OpenRefine (Optional): For advanced data cleaning.
Scalability and Efficiency:
Use asynchronous scraping (via aiohttp or Scrapy) for large-scale tasks.
Implement scraping delay and user-agent rotation to avoid detection and bans.
Storage:
SQLite or MongoDB: For structured data storage.
CSV/JSON: For exporting cleaned data.
2. Core Features and Implementation
A. Data Collection
Scraping Logic:

Use Scrapy or BeautifulSoup for structured platforms (e.g., Google Business).
Use Selenium for dynamically loaded content like LinkedIn.
Extract key fields:
Name
Location (address or coordinates)
Contact details (phone, email)
Industry
Additional fields: Website, ratings, etc.
User-Agent Rotation:

Use the fake_useragent library or services like ScraperAPI to avoid detection.
Ethical Considerations:

Scrape only publicly available data.
Avoid excessive request rates to comply with website terms of service.
B. Data Processing and Cleaning
Handle Missing Values:

Use pandas to fill or drop missing values.
Example: Replace missing phone numbers with "N/A."
Remove Duplicates:

Use pandas.drop_duplicates() to eliminate duplicate entries.
Normalize Data:

Standardize fields (e.g., country codes for phone numbers, consistent date formats).
Prepare for AI/ML:

Export the cleaned data as a CSV or JSON file.
Ensure fields are encoded in a machine-readable format.
C. Scalability and Efficiency
Asynchronous Requests:

Use Scrapy with Twisted or aiohttp for faster requests.
Handle retries and failed requests gracefully.
Batch Processing:

Process data in batches to minimize memory usage.
Rate Limiting:

Add delays between requests to avoid blocking (use time.sleep() or Scrapy's DOWNLOAD_DELAY).
3. Deliverables
A. GitHub Repository
The repository will include:
Scraper Code: Python scripts for data scraping, cleaning, and exporting.
Environment File: requirements.txt with all dependencies.
Sample Dataset: Anonymized and cleaned sample dataset.
B. Sample Dataset
Provide a cleaned and anonymized CSV or JSON file with ~100 records (e.g., names replaced with placeholders).
